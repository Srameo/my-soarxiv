Create this scene in your github page!

A bite-sized clone of SoarXiv’s 3-D “paper universe”, pared down to ~15 items and deployable with nothing but static files.
Use it to showcase research papers, portfolio projects, milestones—anything that has a title and short description.

-------

## ✨ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-paper-galaxy.git
cd my-paper-galaxy

# dependencies needed only for the build step
pip install sentence-transformers umap-learn numpy

# generate 3-D coordinates  (≃1 s for 15 items)
python build.py

# serve the folder (required—browsers block file:// XHR)
python -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```


-------

## 🔄 Update Workflow

1.	Edit papers.json (add / remove / tweak fields).
2.	Run python build.py → regenerates galaxy.json.
3.	Commit & push—GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc. redeploy automatically.

## 🏗️ Pipeline Overview

Stage	Tool	Reason
Text → Embedding	SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")	Tiny, fast, runs offline
Embedding → 3-D	UMAP(n_components=3)	Preserves local structure, good for small sets
Rendering	Vanilla Three.js ES-modules	Zero runtime transpilation, no React/Babel
Picking / Tooltip	Raycaster + tiny HTML overlay	Minimal GPU workload

Everything—including this README—was generated by GPT.

## 📁 File Layout

papers.json   # editable metadata source
build.py      # embedding + UMAP script → galaxy.json
galaxy.json   # autogenerated point cloud
index.html    # one-page Three.js viewer


-------

## 🌐 Deploy

Any static host works:

- GitHub Pages — push to main or gh-pages.
- Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages — drop the folder, no build step needed.
- Embed on your homepage via `<iframe>` or direct link.

-------

## 🛠️ Custom Ideas

- Swap papers for project cards to create a visual projects gallery.
- Use it as a timeline—plot milestones as spheres along a notional time axis.
- Replace spheres with thumbnails or custom shaders for richer visuals.
